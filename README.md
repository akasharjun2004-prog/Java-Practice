Problem: Classify Prime and Non-Prime Numbers from an Array

Write a Java program that takes an array of integers and separates them into 
prime and non-prime numbers. 

Requirements:
1. Create an array of integers.
2. Check each number:
   - If it is a prime number, add it to the list of primes.
   - If it is not prime, add it to the list of non-primes.
3. Print the list of prime numbers.
4. Print the list of non-prime numbers.
5. Implement prime checking manually (do not use inbuilt methods).

Example:
Input Array: [1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 121]

Output:
Prime Numbers : 3 2 5 7 
Non Prime Numbers : 1 6 8 10 121

Hint: 
- A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
- Use optimization: Check divisibility up to the square root of the number.
