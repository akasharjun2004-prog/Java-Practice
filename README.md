Overview

This repository contains classic Java DSA problems solved in a clean and professional way, focusing on core logic, manual implementations, and single-pass algorithms where possible.
All solutions are written without relying on built-in shortcuts to strengthen problem-solving skills, logic building, and interview readiness.

🔹 Features

Solutions written in plain Java with clear methods and functions.

DSA-style approach for numbers, arrays, strings, and more.

Each problem includes:

Input array / numbers

Step-by-step logic

Prime, Palindrome, Armstrong, and more

Individual prints + summary outputs

Single loop optimized solutions where applicable.

Comments explaining each step for learning and revision.

primenumber/ → Prime number & array-based prime problems

palindrome/ → Palindrome number & array-based palindrome problems

armstrong/ → Armstrong number & array-based Armstrong problems

other-problems/ → Future problems (sorting, arrays, strings, recursion, etc.)

📝 Problems Covered

Prime Numbers

Single number check

Array of numbers → classify primes & non-primes

Palindrome Numbers

Single number check

Array of numbers → classify palindromes & non-palindromes

Armstrong Numbers

Single number check

Array of numbers → classify Armstrong & non-Armstrong numbers

(Future)

Factorial, Fibonacci, Sorting, Searching

String reversal, Anagrams, Substrings

Recursion problems, Backtracking

🔧 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Java-DSA-Problems.git


Open in NetBeans / IntelliJ / Eclipse

Run the main() method of the problem you want to execute

Observe output in console

💡 Tips

All solutions are written manually without built-in helper methods for learning clarity.

Each solution prints:

Individual results

Summary output (e.g., all primes, palindromes, Armstrong numbers)

You can add more problems in separate packages or folders to extend the repo.

⭐ Contribution

Feel free to add more Java problems, implement optimized solutions, or improve existing code.
